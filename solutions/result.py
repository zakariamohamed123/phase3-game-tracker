    NOTE:   This test will automatically fail because the specific test is hard-coded 
            to check that the static variable that we create is invoked using `Result.all`. 
            However, the `all` keyword is reserved by Python and, as such, it's poor 
            practice to override it simply for a minor requirement. Adhere to the code 
            challenge requirements to the best of your ability, but understand that this 
            ultimately means the test is poorly architected, not necessarily your code.
